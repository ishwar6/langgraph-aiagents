# Multi-Agent Knowledge Workflow

This project showcases a graph-driven pipeline where specialized agents collaborate to manage and query knowledge. Documents are ingested and chunked, embedded into a vector store, and queried through a conditional workflow. Retrieval confidence governs whether results are summarized automatically or escalated for human review. A FastAPI service exposes endpoints for document upload and querying.
